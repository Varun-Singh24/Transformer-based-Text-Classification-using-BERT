# Transformer-based Text Classification using BERT, DistilBERT & RoBERTa

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of **state-of-the-art Transformer models**—**BERT-base**, **DistilBERT-base**, and **RoBERTa-base**—for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and inference.  
The project is built using **Python** and the **Hugging Face Transformers** library.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Transformer models have revolutionized NLP by enabling contextual understanding of text using self-attention mechanisms.  
In this project, pre-trained transformer models are leveraged to:

- Perform text preprocessing and tokenization
- Run inference using different transformer architectures
- Compare performance and efficiency of large vs lightweight models
